                <p>I am an MSc Computer Science student and musician at the University of St Andrews.</p>
                <p>I undertook undergraduate studies at the University of Leeds, where I studied BSc Accounting and Finance.
                Through evening courses and a lot of trial and error, I was able to learn enough programming to pursue this masters course.
                My experience has mostly been in Java, however Python, JavaScript, and HTML have also had the pleasure of being prodded around with from yours truly.</p>
                <p>Still relatively new to programming, I'm not yet looking to specialise and have been enjoying getting exposure to varied aspects of computer science,
                some of which you can see on the projects page.</p>
                <p>My music projects can be found here. I play and write in The Montaines band, enjoy putting together projects with talented
                musicians, and I'm working on some material of my own.</p>
