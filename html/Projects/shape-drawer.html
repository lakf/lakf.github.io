<h1>Shape Drawer</h1>
<p>This project was a part of my St Andrews MSc Computer Science 21/22. The idea was to create a similar program to MS Paint.</p>
<!-- Description -->

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Shape Drawer is a program in which the user can draw predefined shapes onto the screen, choosing the colour through a colour setting menu, and choosing the size by clicking the mouse at an origin and releasing at the desired scale. The program has undo and redo functionality, where the user can undo an unlimited number of shapes and redo them as expected.</p>
<p>The objective of the Shape Drawer project was to firstly, develop my java object orientated design skills, but also to gain exposure to working with Java Swing. This was my first foray into building a GUI and I did so using a model - view - controller model.</p>
