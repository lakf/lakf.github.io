<!-- Description -->
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Humans have recorded events since 37,000 BP. In modern times, monumental and non-monumental events are constantly recorded through videos and pictures. A child’s first steps, a graduation, or the completion of a marathon are as easily recordable as a selfie on the sofa or a picture of this week’s grocery list. The skiing environment presents an area where memorable events remain difficult to capture. Handheld cameras such as the GoPro or smartphone cameras have made this recording easier, but as they are not designed specifically for the skiing environment, they still fall short of being “user-friendly”. This project aims to tackle the challenges of designing a system capable of recording memorable events in a skiing environment in a user-friendly manner. The project follows a rigorous design process as well as usability literature, eventually producing a working prototype in the form of a series of cameras capturing footage directed by a location tracking mobile application. The success of the design is then evaluated in a subsequent usability study which assesses its success as a user-friendly system.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A skiing holiday is no exception to the fact that when people are creating memorable
    moments, they like to capture those moments to reflect on and share. However, unlike other
    memorable moments such as a child’s first nativity, going to a football game, or visiting
    Disney Land, the landscape, environment, and nature of skiing makes capturing those
    moments incredibly difficult. Skiing is a fast and dangerous sport, carried out in extreme and
    treacherous conditions. In one sense this adds to the memorability of the events which take
    place, these out of the ordinary variables increase the worthiness of those memories being
    captured. However simultaneously, these variables make those memories more difficult to
    capture and make for a frustrating experience of using the existing solutions for capturing ski
    film.
</p>
<p>
    This project focuses on designing and building a user-friendly ski film system by following a
    user-centered design process. The motivation for the project is that the current solutions for
    capturing skiing footage provide a poor user experience which results in memorable
    moments, which the user would like to capture, going uncaptured and being lost.
