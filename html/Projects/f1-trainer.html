<h1>F1 Driver Trainer</h1>
<p>This project was a part of my St Andrews MSc Computer Science 21/22. It's aim was to get a more intricate experience at building hardware (this project repurposed an Xbox Kinect) and software together.</p>

<!-- Description -->
<p>I had the opportunity to work on an exciting endeavor aimed at enhancing the training of Formula 1 (F1) drivers. I utilized the capabilities of the Xbox Kinect camera and developed software to create a game that incorporated depth vision. By leveraging the Kinect camera's advanced depth-sensing technology, I designed a dynamic training experience that simulated various exercises to improve the skills of aspiring F1 drivers. The game provided a realistic environment where drivers could practice crucial aspects such as precise maneuvering, quick reflexes, and optimal braking techniques.

<p>This project focused on revolutionizing the training process for Formula 1 drivers by integrating depth vision and interactive gaming. Using the Xbox Kinect camera and custom-developed software, I constructed a captivating training game. By leveraging the Kinect camera's ability to perceive depth, I designed a series of challenging exercises that accurately replicated the demands faced by F1 drivers on the race track. Through interactive gameplay, drivers were immersed in a virtual environment that required them to make split-second decisions, navigate intricate racing circuits, and master precise steering control, thereby honing their skills and improving their overall performance on the track.</p>
