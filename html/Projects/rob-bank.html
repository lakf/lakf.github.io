<h1>Rob Bank</h1>
<p>This project was a part of my St Andrews MSc Computer Science 21/22. It's aim was to get initial experience at building hardware and software together.</p>

<!-- Description -->
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Rob Bank is a single player game in which the user must input combinations of actions to unlock a vault and “rob the bank”. There are six sets of combinations which the user must pass through, if they fail to do so within the time limit they lose. Key hardware used includes the BBC Microbit and various extra components. All software was written in Make Code for Microbit and Processing.
</p>
<p>This project had two aims. Firstly, it needed to be a fun and interactive game because a boring game is never played and thus redundant. Secondly, it needed to use a range of inputs and outputs to demonstrate the skills I had learned in both hardware and software. Therefore, it was key to think about how I could include many inputs and outputs but still use them in a meaningful way which contributes to, rather than clutters, the gameplay.</p>
