        <h1>The Simple Approach to Training</h1>
        <div class="section-inner">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The intention of this article is to show a simple but effective training program which gives great and achievable results without requiring supplements or unrealistic commitment.

               </p><p> I am no expert in personal training or nutrition, however through trial and error I have assembled a plan which gives the results seen below. I have been training on and off as an amateur for nine years but have never taken training or nutrition ultra-seriously (and don't intend to). But everyone wants to be in shape once in a while and I believe this is a simple way to get there. Following this plan for six weeks made me lose 7kg (84kg to 77kg) whilst all strength increased or maintained.</p>

            <h2>Approach</h2>
            <p>The approach is to keep things as simple as possible. The path involves eating in a calorie deficit (using more calories than you eat), this is what makes you lose fat. Simultaneously, by consuming the prescribed amount of protein you will build or maintain muscle.

            </p><p>Diet is more important than the workouts. You cannot out-train a bad diet so don't try. Follow both (diet and workouts) for optimal results, but if you'd rather pick and choose be my guest.</p>
            
            <h2>Diet</h2>
            <p>For nutrition you will calculate your target calories and macronutrients of protein, carbs, and fats (maybe I'll build a calculator if requested). Follow the below steps.
                <ol>1. Calculate Total Calories ->
                
                    Formula: Total Calories = YOUR BODYWEIGHT IN KG x 24.2
                    
                    Example:
                    80kg x 24.2 = 1936 total calories per day.</ol>
                
                <ol>2. Calculate Protein ->
                
                    Formula: 
                    Protein grams = YOUR BODYWEIGHT IN KG x 2.5
                    
                    Example: 
                    80 x 2.5 = 200g protein per day.</ol>
                
                <ol>3. Calculate Fats ->
                
                    Formula: Fat grams = YOUR BODYWEIGHT IN KG x 0.75
                    
                    Example:
                    80 x 0.75 = 60g fats per day.</ol>
                
                <ol>4. Calculate Carbs ->
                
                    Formula: 
                    Carbs grams = (Total Calories - (Protein x 4) - (Fats x 9))/4
                    
                    Example:
                    (1936 - (200x4) - (60x9))/4 = 149g carbs per day.</ol>
                
                <ol>5. Work out your food ->
                
                    Now create an excel sheet with the headings shown below. Research on supermarket websites to find the EXACT foods that you can fit in. Meet your protein requirements first and the rest will follow. I recommend leaving a gap to account for inaccuracies in supermarket measurements. Try to spend carbs on the most satiating foods possible (for me this is bread) and use cheats where possible.</p></ol>
                
            <h2>Workouts</h2>
            <p>5 days a week you should push weights and do a 300 calorie burning cardio session.

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>That's all you need to achieve solid results. In the following section I'll add some additional thoughts, but skip these if you're short on time. Email me any questions and let me know of how the program works out for you (maclark25@gmail.com).</p>
            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <ol>Sustainability - The largest hurdle is keeping consistent. This is difficult when we have busy and social lives. I believe this plan is not sustainable for longer than two months for reasons below, but there are things you can do to improve its sustainability (discussed below).

            </ol><ol>Social - Lots of social events involve food and drink. Navigate how you see fit.
                
            </ol><ol>Mental Capacity - Living in a calorie deficit reduced my capacity for long periods of focus. Black decaf/coffee is a helpful hack but can only carry you so far.</ol><ol>
            </ol><ol>Mood Fluctuations - Feeling hungry will affect some people's moods. Some people can operate under hunger better than others. Be nice to yourself by satiating as optimally as possible and use low calorie treats (some yoghurt, sugar free jelly).</ol><ol>
            </ol><ol>Eating Timings - I can operate well without food until about 2pm, but I love to eat before bed. Therefore, I push all my eating to later in the day. Some people call this intermittent fasting, some calling eating when you're hungry. Experiment with what spread of food feels best for you, then commit to a schedule. Some people need a heavy breakfast, some want constant small snacks, and some want one 2000 cal meal at the end of the day. As long as you're eating within the numbers we worked out earlier, you're fine.</ol><ol>
            </ol><ol>Vitamin Deficiency - Restricting what you eat/ repetitive eating can lead to vitamin deficiency. Combat this by throwing in veg where possible and taking multi-vitamins. I am in no way claiming this style of eating is healthy, potentially the opposite (see sustainability).</ol><ol>
            </ol><ol>Sustainable Cardio - You can burn 300 calories easily with a 5k run, but the likelihood of you doing a 5k run 5 days a week is low (muscle fatigue, will power etc). Make your cardio easier by making it low impact (and potentially enjoyable?). For me, a 60 min walk at 15 mins per mile is easy, sustainable, and enjoyable. If quicker cardio is needed, 300 cals on the elliptical can be taken out in less than 22 mins with a nice level of sweat.</p>
