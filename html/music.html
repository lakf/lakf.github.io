            <p>The Montaines (formerly The Rebecca Riots), is a musical partnership between Gethin Griffith, Luke Jones, and myself. We originally began making music together in 2017 and since then the group has seen many iterations. The Montaines have played at every unfrequented pub in the country, having done gigs all around North Wales, but also having played in Manchester, Liverpool, and London.</p>
            <p>Only a fraction of the material produced with The Montaines was ever recorded and released, however on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5oDErf8hurkoNm1FhkKMu9?si=nDwRWsEfSnqi77SMb-Q3lg">band's spotify</a> you can find a 2021 EP titled "A Granby Slice". This is an amalgamation of songs recorded all the way from 2017 to 2021.</p>
            <p>The Montaines are all set to record another EP in July '22.</p>

            <p>At the end of 2021 I had the pleasure of jamming and recording some Christmas music with Jamal Marcelin. That collection can be <a href="https://soundcloud.com/michael-clark-227/sets/mike-jamal-christmas-project?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing">found here</a>.</p>
